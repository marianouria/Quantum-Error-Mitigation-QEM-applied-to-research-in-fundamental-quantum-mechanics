**Introduction**

Duality and entanglement are perhaps the most prominent hallmarks of quantum mechanics. Both evoke a sense of weirdness which has been however no obstacle for their instrumentation as powerful tools, useful not only for an accurate description of physical phenomena but for many practical applications as well. It is thus important to elucidate the various possible forms in which duality and entanglement manifest themselves. Recent developments have shown that the defining features of duality and entanglement may arise in both the quantum and the classical domain. An important result in this respect is the established polarization-coherence theorem (PCT). 

**Implementation in the quantum computer**

As is shown in the paper<sup>1</sup>, I have to make a quantum state that have two degrees of freedom, one for polarization and the other for paths, this objective was reached by using an ancilla qubit which is entanglement with polarization qubit to get a mixed state in polarization. To control the polarization, I use the variable P in the entangled initial state and to control the angle $\delta$  between the bloch vector and the unitary operation I did a rotation around the X axis. Finally, to obtain a unitary operation in one arm I used a control-Ry gate which had the last parameter $\gamma$.
