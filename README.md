**Introduction**

Duality and entanglement are perhaps the most prominent hallmarks of quantum mechanics. Both evoke a sense of weirdness which has been however no obstacle for their instrumentation as powerful tools, useful not only for an accurate description of physical phenomena but for many practical applications as well. It is thus important to elucidate the various possible forms in which duality and entanglement manifest themselves. Recent developments have shown that the defining features of duality and entanglement may arise in both the quantum and the classical domain. An important result in this respect is the established polarization-coherence theorem (PCT).
